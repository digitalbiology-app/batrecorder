Originally released on the Google Play Store, Bat Recorder is an Android app designed to record and analyze ultrasonic audio such as bat echolocation calls. The code for the app is now provided free under the GNU license - contributions that improve the app and fix bugs are very much desired and welcome.

There was a known bug where the USB driver gets overwhelmed with data on certain deivces, causing period skips in data acquisition. This has been fixed by Radek DiLuca of Dodotronic (www.dodtronic.com)! Much appreciated!

Note that to use this code base, you will need your own key for the Google Maps API.
